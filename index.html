        <p>
          <span style="font-style:italic">
            This short biography was written after an interview for an article in Esquire in 1984. Most of the article remains close enough to being true that it gives an accurate picture of how I try to live my life.
          </span><br><br>

            Mac Hyman is a computational scientist who bridges the gap between mathematical models that describe scientific and engineering problems their approximate solution on the computer. The main thrust of research is to improve the reliability, accuracy and availability of computer approximations. This, in turn, enhances the effectiveness and judgement of scientists and engineers in making design decisions and reduces the amount of expensive laboratory and field testing.

            He was born in a small town in central Florida the first day of spring 1950 and grew up among the orange groves, phosphate mines and cattle ranches. He was an Eagle scout, has always been an avid camper, photographer, and though no records exist (he never got caught) had a happy adventurous childhood.

          <br><br>
            In school, it was fated early on that he was to become a mathematician. He couldn't spell, had terrible trouble memorizing facts and dates, but he found mathematics easy because "you only need to understand a few simple relationships and everything else can be derived from them." This tendency to do what came easy was reinforced by the joy of discovering new relationships and their implications. He was ten when he made the decision to become a mathematician.

          <br><br>
            He studied math and physics at Tulane University on an Air Force scholarship and all went smoothly until he met his first computer in 1969. The computer offered the opportunity to visualize the solutions of nonlinear equations he had previously considered intractable. The computer became as valuable as calculus had been in expanding his understanding. The mold was set, and he became a numerical analyst and strived to obtain an equal balance in his studies of physics, math, and computer science. In 1972 he graduated from Tulane with honors in math and physics and received the Glendy Burke mathematics medal for undergraduate studies.

              The Hertz Foundation provided the money and Peter Lax, his advisor, the guidance in his graduate studies at the Courant Institute. At Courant he cultivated a theoretical background in the same three disciplines and received his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1976. Lax worked in Los Alamos during the war and encouraged him round out his training in an applied research program there.

              <br><br>
                His science blended well with the technical climbing and skiing available in Los Alamos. When on a mountain, as emersed in a calculation, he becomes a part of it - totally absorbed in what he's doing. The ski slopes are 15 minutes from his office and (in a good year) he is on the slopes 40-50 days a year - skiing fast, often out of control (some say wild), with a little bit of style and a lot of enthusiasm. A close friend characterized him by "he skis like he does mathematics." The statement works both ways.

          <br><br>
            His long term research goal is to unify and simplify the theory and implementation of algorithms for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. These equations are the crucial element of most computer codes modeling physics. One future application will be construction of an artificial intelligence or expert computer system that will automatically generate a computer code approximating the solution to mathematical models for, say, oil flow in a reservoir, laser fusion or the weather. The user will need only to describe the model in a standard mathematical language; the expert systems will then dynamically build the appropriate comptuer code, solve these equations, and analyse the results. His first prototype code developed along these lines, MOL1D (written in 1975), was one of the first packages for the automatic solution of these equations.

          <br><br>
            The code is still widely used in scientific computing laboratories and university departments throughout the world and has been applied to complicated problems in combustion, climate and weather models, economic forecasting, plasma physics, atmospheric and water pollution, and the pattern formation of chicken feathers on an embryo. Currently, he is working with Martin Staley to design and implement a more powerful C++ interactive problem solving environment for solving PDEs.

          <br><br>
            His research is highly interdisciplinary and he has written over a dozen computer codes and published over a hundred research papers in fields including: shock waves, soliton theory, restoring blurred pictures, adaptive numerical methods, significance arithmetic, and structured software design.

          <br><br>
            He is a member of the various proper scientific societies with Greek letters and strongly promotes interactions between the national laboratories, industry, and universities. To this end he has supported and helped create the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos. He continues to work closely with the Center by organizing workshops and coordinating their summer graduate student research program. As group leader of the Mathematical Modeling and Analysis group, he strives to maintain a close ties between the Laboratory research an Academia.

    <h2> Q&A with James Hyman </h2>
    <div class="card-content">
        <div class="question">
          Favorite Hobbies
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          dancing (African, Haitian, jazz), skiing down a mountain in deep (DEEP!) powder, playing (at) the piano, walking in a warm rain, fishing for the big ones from the beach in an outgoing tide, and proving those elusive theorems. My favorite 'hobby' for the past ten years has been to be a part of the Oxymoron dance ensemble. We don't measure progress by the height of our leaps, but by how much our smiles push our ears back.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          I have learned that
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          juggling is not as hard as it looks, but it did take three times longer to learn than I thought it would; that if I'm not the first person in the ski lift line on a powder day, someone else will be; that the world loves to laugh and enjoy life, but it doesn't happen nearly as often as it should; and that it is most important to live your life so you believe in and like yourself.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Favorite way to pay the bills
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          I still love hacking out code.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Most proud of
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Kathryn and Jeff â who could ask for more than two great kids!
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          What fills your spirit?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
 hiking in a fluffy snow fall, getting so lost reading a book that I can't put it down, meeting smiling happy people, drifting through a soft dream as the sun comes up, frisky dogs, and playful cats, skiing through power so deep that I can't see where I'm going, photography, drawing with charcoal and pastels, musicmusicmusic and more music, (I have withdrawal pains if I can't play - I need it, it's an addiction that I can't and don't want to stop.) dance dance dance and more dancing, (Hey, I can be obsessed with more than one addiction.)
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Right now I'd rather be...
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
There are so many places and things I love to do that I have to answer this question in terms of my whole life, and not moment by moment. If I really want to be doing something else, I have to go for it. If I don't do it this year, I'll just be a little older when I do. Life is not like marking time in a rehearsal and it would be crazy to treat it that way.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Message to the opposite sex
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
 The differences between the sexes are absolutely delightful. How wonderful that that there are (at least) two sexes.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Most notable physical attributes
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
I make up for lacking hair on top with a full beard. Also, my form never has been nearly as great as my smile while dancing, skiing, and biking. Luckily I have a sense of balance that has saved my ass in countless times when Iâve gone over the edge.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
New Yearâs resolution
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
Every year I pick up something to do for the first time and focus on learning it for the next year. The last couple of years it has been learning Afro/Haitian dance, playing the piano, learning Spanish, tennis, painting (watercolor, pastels), writing poetry and mountain biking. This way Iâm always a beginner when learning is the most fun. In the last couple of years I have focused on playing jazz piano, Chinese calligraphy, ceramics, and I've had great time learning to cook. Recently I started growing exotic fruits and berries (jujubes, pawpaws, medlars, hardy kiwis, quince, etc.) Last year I started creating ceramic sculptures and am still loving to play with the mud. My latest hobby is to collect wild stones from the mountains for sculpting. The wild stones have more character, hidden faults, and fractures than domesticated stones from a quarry. I just seem to relate more to the wild variety. It's been fun to get the USGS rock and topo maps and head out on a quest. Somehow I think that sculpting stone will be more constrained than working in the clay, but it will be fun to give it a try.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Most regret
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
Not having more time to spend relaxing and doing more with my friends and family.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Most embarrassing moment
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
letting my weight get out of control and performing a dance on stage. (After seeing the video of the dance I started eating right, exercising more and knocked off 25 pounds.)
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          If I Win The Lottery...
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
I'd set up a fund to provide ways to encourage and help people enjoy life and the world around them. It might be to support making the all of the arts more accessible and available to everyone from children to the retirement centers.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Everything I ever needed to know, I learned by...
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
following my heart and inner voices, seeking out friends who care for others and the world around them, and by living a full life. I just keep trying to be better than I was yesterday.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Favorite Popular Music
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
This is an impossible one. I love the torch songs of Jane Monheit, Diana Krall, Christine Hitt, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Holly Cole, of course Ella, Ella, Ella and the ever present Billie Holiday. I keep returning to the (early) barroom ballads of Steve Goodman, John Prine, Guy Clark, and even Jimmy Buffet before he got too much into himself. There are the old songs from Eddy Howard to Louis Jordan. Then I love Nat King Cole's smooth voice, his daughter's wonderous music, and his often forgotten brother, Eddy. Who cannot love Louie Armstrong playing his horn, or playing with us with his voice. I can float on the gentle sounds of Kurt Elling or the haunting music of Virginia Rodrigues and Susana Baca. IZ is the man, when it comes to Hawaiian music. Jonny Lang's 'Good Morning Little Schoolgirl' was a stroke of genius for a 16 year old. I dance to the beat of Manu Chao, Baaba Maal, Amon Tobin and pop music from the before the Beatles to those Bare Naked Ladies and Dave's True Story. What would life be without variety.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Favorite Classical Music
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
I turn to the old masters, all styles and all forms.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          Community Service
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
is mostly centered around the Los Alamos Little Theater and organizing a summer program for applied mathematics students. When all the dust settles, I probably spend a couple of weeks a year working with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) organizing conferences and on the journals. Recently, I enjoyed helping the SIAM office launch two new journals: one on dynamical systems and one on multiscale modeling.

        <div class="question">
          Cars, Trucks, and Planes
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
When you live in the mountains, you don't want to be held back by a dirt road or a snow drift. My favorite truck is an 89 Montero that can go just about anywhere.
        </div>

        <div class="question">
What I would save if my, house was burning down
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
Save the living first. When my family and pets are safe then I would go after the irreplacibles: the videos and photo albums, the paintings and drawings, handwritten letters and notes, and then get the hell out of there.

Dance as though no one is watching you, Love as though you have never been hurt before, Sing as though no one can hear you, Live as though heaven is on earth. Remember: Life is short, Break the rules, Forgive quickly, Kiss slowly, Love truly, Laugh uncontrollably, And never regret anything that made you smile.
